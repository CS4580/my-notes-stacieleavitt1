# Module 7 Notes: Metrics and Model Development


## Metrics

Metrics should be `unbiased`, universal, and concise.
    
1. A way to obtain similar responses
2. A way to measure the performance 
3. A way to measure prediction. 

For our sample analysis we will use `KNN` K-Nearest Neighbor
- `K` is an arbitrary pick
- Need a `base case`
- Compare the neighbors
- Sor the results

Dataset for this analysis: 
```bash
icarus.cs.weber.edu:~hvalle/cs4580/data/movies.csv
```


### KNN-Euclidean Distance

Note: All code will be in `knn_analysis.py`


The Euclidean distance is the distance between points in `N-dimensional` space.

Formula
$
d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i - p_i)^2}
$
where:
- $p = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$
- $q = (q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)$

#### Task: 
Find the distance between these points:
- x = (0,0)
- y = (4,4)

Distance = 5.65685...

```python
# see
def euclidean_distance()
```

### KNN with Jaccard Similarity Index
Compares members of two individual sets to determine which members are `shared` and which are `distinct`. The index measures the similarity between the two sets. 

$$
J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
$$

Ex: $A = {1, 2, 3, 4}$ and $B = {3, 4, 5, 6}$ = $\frac{2}{6}$ or $0.33$

```python
# see
def jaccard_similarity_normal()
```

### KNN with Weighted Jaccard Similarity Index
The traditional Jaccard works well when doing `one-to-one` comparisons between a category. 

One solution is the `weighted` version. 
- Build a dictionary for `each genre` of the movies in our preferred list 

```python
# see
def jaccard_similarity_weighted()
```

### KNN with Levenshtein Distance 
This is the most common form of edit-based metric, which generally quantifies to work required to transform a string from an initial sequence to a target sequence. 
- It is used to determine the difference between two sequences (strings)
- It is the distance between two words (minimum number of digits edits)
    - insertions, deletions, or substitutions
$$
D(i, j) = 
\begin{cases}
j & \text{if } i = 0 \\
i & \text{if } j = 0 \\
D(i-1, j-1) & \text{if } s[i] = t[j] \\
1 + \min \{D(i-1, j), D(i, j-1), D(i-1, j-1)\} & \text{if } s[i] \neq t[j]
\end{cases}
$$

#### For Example:
Consider these strings:
- s = 'kitten'
- t = 'sitting'

Find the 'Levenshteain' Distance
1. Substitute `k` with `s` in `kitten` -> `sitten` (1 substitution)
2. Substitute `e` with `i` in `sitten` -> `sittin` (1 substitution)
3. Insert `g` at the end of `sittin` -> `sitting` (1 insertion)

Result is 3 edits, so the distances is $ = 3$

def knn_levenshtein_title()
```
Need this package
```bash
# VE must be running python 3.11 or less
pip install Levenshtein
```
